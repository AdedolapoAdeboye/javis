# Javis
An multi-platform to-do application written in python for Android, Apple iOS, Apple Macintosh OS, Debian Linux and Windows OS. There is no plan for other Linux distros at the moment but if you want it, you can support me or collaborate with me on building it for your specific need.
- This is a one-man project. Development process might not be that fast, but updates and new features will be added steady.
- You can edit the source code and compile yourself or download a pre-copiled file via the link provided below:
